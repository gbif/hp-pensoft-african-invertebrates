**African Invertebrates** is an international peer-reviewed, open-access journal that focuses primarily on the taxonomy, systematics, biogeography, and palaeontology of Afrotropical invertebrates, whether terrestrial, freshwater or marine. Aspects concerning biology, ecology, collections data and conservation may also be considered. Papers dealing solely with physiology, pests and pest control should be submitted elsewhere.
